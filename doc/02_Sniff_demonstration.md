# Demonstrate interactional motivation with the Sniff Experiment

Execute `puzzle_game_interactional_motivation.py imo` to run the experiment.
The `imo` argument makes the agent controlled by the Interactional Motivation Schema Mechanism.

## Define the agent's possibilities of interaction 

The agent has 6 possible actions that may yield 5 possible outcomes:

| Code |  Action          |
|---|--------------------|
| 0 | sniff front         |
| 1 | move forward       |
| 2 | sniff left          |
| 3 | sniff right         |
| 4 | Turn left          |
| 5 | Turn right         |


| Code | Outcome  | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 0    | decrease | The smell decreased. |
| 1    | stable   | The smell remained stable. |
| 2    | increase | The smell increased. |
| 3    | wall     | The agent bumped into a wall or sniffed a wall. |
| 4    | eat      | The agent reached and ate the target. |

The valences of interactions are defined as follows:

| Action       | Outcome   | Valence | Description                               |
|--------------|-----------|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| move forward | stable    |  10     | There was no smell or it remained stable. |
| move forward | wall      | -10     | The agent bumped into a wall.             |
| turn left    | stable    | -3      | Turned toward same smell.             |
| turn left    | decrease  | -3      | Turned toward weaker smell or wall |
| turn right   | stable    | -3      | Turned toward same smell.             |
| turn right   | decrease  | -3      | Turned toward weaker smell or wall |
| sniff front  | stable    | -1      | Sniff no smell or same in front
| sniff front  | wall      | -1      | Sniffed a wall in front | 
| sniff left   | stable    | -1      | Sniff no smell or same on the left |
| sniff left   | wall      | -1      | Sniffed a wall on the left |
| sniff right  | stable    | -1      | Sniff no smell or same on the right |
| sniff right  | wall      | -3      | Sniffed a wall on the right |
| move forward | decrease  | -1      | The smell decreased as the agent moved forward.  |
| move forward | increase  |  10     | The smell increased as the agent moved forward.  |
| move forward | eat       |  10     | The agent reached and ate the target.  |
| sniff front  | decrease  | -1      | The smell is weaker in front.  |
| sniff front  | increase  | -1      | The smell is stronger in front.  |
| sniff left   | decrease  | -1      | The smell is weaker on the left.  |
| sniff left   | increase  | -1      | The smell is stronger on the left.  |
| sniff right  | decrease  | -1      | The smell is weaker on the right.  |
| sniff right  | increase  | -1      | The smell is stronger on the right.  |

The agent initially ignores the meaning of actions and outcomes. 
It has no knowledge that it exists in a two-dimensional grid with walls and a target emitting smell.

In short, the agent does not know what it is doing, but it knows whether it likes it or not!

It will learn to prefer behaviors that lead to positive-valence interactions, such as moving forward when the smell increases or reaching and eating the target. 
It learns nonetheless to use negative-valence "epistemic interactions" such as sniffing around to gather information about its environment.
Actions that lead to negative-valence interactions, such as bumping into walls or turning towards less smell, will be avoided over time.

## The demonstrations

Since the smell does not pass through walls, the agent will eventually reach the target by ascending the smell gradient (represented by the gradiant of green in the right-hand screen).

### Developmental learning starting in the maze

This run was obtained with the commit [426572f](https://github.com/PetiteIA/AIRIS_Public/commit/426572f9d930b5309bb7b1555c345132387fa204).

_Video 1: Example run in which the agent learns the "vigilant behavior". The sniffing interactions are materialized on the right side of the display as flashing squares: the agent can sniff in front, left, or right. Smell gradient is represented in green.
Bumping interactions are indicated by flashing red walls._

Because the agent begins in the maze, it learns to sniff around to avoid bumping into walls before learning to move toward the target.
We call "vigilant behavior" this habit of sniffing in front to avoid bumping into walls.

When it is put in the open grid after eating the second target, the agent keeps the vigilant behavior even though there is less risk of bumping into walls.

### Developmental learning starting in the open grid

This run was obtained with the commit [2467ce5](https://github.com/PetiteIA/AIRIS_Public/commit/2467ce536e31766f91f595653b0f78956417a512): same agent, different ordering of game levels.

_Video 2: Example run in which the agent learns the "bold behavior"._

Because the agent begins its development in a relatively open grid, it quickly learns to approach and eat the target.
We call "bold behavior" this habit of confidently moving forward without sniffing in front, at the risk of bumping into walls.

![img/01_trace_plot.svg](img/01_trace_plot.svg)

_Figure 2: Trace of the example run shown in Video 2.
On Steps 519 and 529, the agent successfully completed the re-enaction of an 8-step schema._

When the agent is put in the maze after eating the first target, it eventually learns a version of the vigilant behavior, 
but when it is put back in the open grid after eating the second target, it returns to the bold behavior that it has learned in the initial phase of its development. 


## Conclusion


What interests us in this experiment is not particularly that the agent manages to reach the target. 
Of course, it does because it likes the increase of smell.

But what is more interesting is that it learns different kinds of behaviors depending on the training trajectory it undergoes (the "vigilant behavior" or the "bold behavior").
Moreover, it learns to actively use "epistemic interactions" (sniffing) to avoid negative-valence interactions (bumping into walls) even though these epistemic interactions have a negative valence themselves.

The agent is deterministic, so it will always generate exactly the same behavior in a given configuration.
There is, however, a deterministic-chaos effect in the sense that a small change in the initial conditions leads to different behaviors.
We nonetheless observe the emergence of some version of the vigilant behavior when the agent starts in the maze and some version of the bold behavior when it starts in the open grid.  

Schemas can be considered as small programs that the agent learns and re-executes as a whole in the appropriate context.
Demonstrating a 10-step self-programming effect (as in Figure 1) constitutes an innovative result in itself. 

## Tutorial

See the tutorial [IM_Tutorial_03.ipynb](IM_Tutorial_03.ipynb) for more technical explanations and to try different valences of interactions.

## Discussion

Of course, if the agent encounters a local maximum of smell, it will be trapped in the vicinity of that maximum and will never reach the target.

This is when the agent may want to form an explicit goal representation of the target and engage in navigation problem solving to reach it. 
It may then learn to descend the gradient of smell to bypass the local maximum.

This raises the question of the emergence of goals based on innate behavioral preferences, which will be our next topic of research.
